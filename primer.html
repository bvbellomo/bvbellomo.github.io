	<h1>A Primer on Molecular Biology</h1>
	
	<p><span class='term'>Genes</span> control the synthesis of <span class='term'>proteins</span>, which are the most important molecules making up all life. 
	Life is not just protein, for example, an oak tree is made up mostly of polysaccharides.  
	But it is genes and proteins that determine what makes an oak tree a tree and not a fish or a bird or a bacterium.</p>
	
	<p>Genes are stored, replicated and passed on in <span class='term'>DNA</span>. DNA is <span class='term'>transcribed</span> into <span class='term'>messenger RNA</span> <span class="abbr">(mRNA)</span>. 
	When a mRNA molecule reaches a <span class='term'>ribosome</span>, it is <span class='term'>translated</span> into <span class='term'>polypeptide chains</span>, which <span class='term'>fold</span> into proteins. 
	DNA, RNA and polypeptide chains are all <span class='term'>linear polymers</span> – long molecules composed of smaller repeating subunits.</p>
	
	<p><span class="abbr">RNA</span> is an abbreviation for <span class="term">RiboNucleic Acid</span>, as it is a long chain of repeating <span class="term">ribose</span> subunits, each of which has a <span class="term">nucleotide</span> attached. 
	These nucleotides can be <span class="term">guanine</span> <span class="abbr">(G)</span> , <span class="term">uracil</span> <span class="abbr">(U)</span> , <span class="term">adenine</span> <span class="abbr">(A)</span> , or <span class="term">cytosine</span> <span class="abbr">(T)</span> . 
	<span class="term">Hydrogen bonds</span> form nucleotides, most commonly 3 bounds between G and C and 2 bonds between U and T. 
	These bonds can control the shape of the RNA molecule, forming different structures. 
	The ribosome itself is mostly composed of RNA. 
	Some scientists speculate that early life came from an <span class="term">RNA World</span>, as RNA could theoretically contain and copy genetic information as well as serve as the structure of organisms before DNA or proteins. 
	Since ribose is not symmetrical, neither is RNA. Scientists refer to a <span class="term">3 Prime</span> <span class="abbr">(3’)</span> and <span class="term">5 prime</span> <span class="abbr">(5’)</span> end of RNA. 
	These terms came from the convention of numbering Carbon atoms in a ribose molecule from 1’ to 5’.
	</p>

	<p><span class="abbr">DNA</span> is an abbreviation for <span class="term">DeoxyriboNucleic Acid</span>, and is similar to RNA. 
	Deoxyribose is similar to ribose, but lacks an −OH, which in chemistry is called a <span class="term">hydroxyl group</span>, giving us the terms <span class="term">deoxy sugar</span> and <span class="term">Deoxyribose</span>. 
	This difference in structure leads to DNA forming the well-known double-helix structure – a deoxyribose backbone with nucleotides is paired with another deoxyribose backbone with opposite nucleotides. 
	This arrangement facilitates copying DNA or transcription, since when separating both strands, either strand contains all the genetic information of the pair, and either a new pair or messager RNA can be created. 
	This structural change, however, limits the number of structures DNA can fold into, making an organism built entirely of DNA implausible. 
	Similar to RNA, we can use the 3’ and 5’ convention to refer to direction, but can also use <span class="term">positive</span> and <span class="term">negative</span> strands, or <span class="term">coding</span> and <span class="term">template</span> strands. 
	In DNA, uracil is replaced by <span class="term">thymine</span> <span class="abbr">(T)</span>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	During <span class="term">translation</span>, the RNA molecule structure is broken so the ribosome can read RNA as a sequence of nucleotides, this process is referred to as <span class="term">elongation</span>.
	The mRNA is read from the 3’ end. The first section of the mRNA typically doesn’t encode for a protein, and since it is towards the 5’ end, it is referred to as the <span class="term">5 prime untranslated region</span><span class="abbr">(5’ UTR)</span>.
	Nucleotides are translated in sequences of <span class="term">codons</span>, 3 nucleotides which identify a specific amino acid that should be added to a polypeptide chain to create the protein.	The mRNA is read until the first <span class="term">start codon</span>, typically AUG.
	3 possible combinations of 4 possible nucleotides gives 64 possible combinations. 
	With only 20 amino acids coded for in unexceptional circumstances, there is redundancy in this code, for example, ‘CUU, CUC, CUA and CUG all typically encode the amino acid Leucine. 
	Each codon is associated with a <span class="term">transfer RNA</span><span class="abbr">(tRNA)</span>, which is a molecule of RNA specific to the codon that carries the amino acid. 
	Normally each tRNAs must be available, if CUU is read and that tRNA is unavailable, it doesn’t matter if CUC CUA or CUG codons are available, translation will stop. 
	A codon for a tRNA that doesn’t arrive in time typically aborts the translation and the partial protein product is recycled. 
	Life has exceptions to rules, and there are some cases, known as wobble-pairs, where a different tRNA can be used that encodes the same animo acid. 
	Nucleotides are read until a <span class="term">stop codon</span> (typically UAG, UAA, or UGA) is reached.  Typically, there is still some RNA after the stop codon, and this region is referred to as the <span class="term">3 prime untranslated region</span><span class="abbr">(3’UTR)</span>. 
	Typically, a single mRNA is read in parallel by several ribosomes at once.  The translation process is remarkably similar between all known forms of life.
